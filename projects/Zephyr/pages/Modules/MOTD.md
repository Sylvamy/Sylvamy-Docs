The MOTD module is incredibly simple, it sends a message to players when they join the server.

The message sent is configured in `plugins/Zephyr/Modules/motd.txt`

Anything in the MOTD file will be sent to players when they join, PlaceholderAPI is supported in this file, it also has a built in placeholder of {player} for the players username.

Disable the module in the config to stop motd's being sent.
